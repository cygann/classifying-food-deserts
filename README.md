Food Deserts are regions of the United States with limited access to affordable and nutritious food. Aimed at helping policy-makers and produce-providers understand where to best focus their efforts to alleviate food security, we built a predictive model to classify areas as food deserts or not using socioeconomic features and identified which of these features were the best predictors of food deserts. The best model was a neural network that achieved f-1 scores of 0.72 for both classes.
